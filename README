This is a WIP refactor of mgr to use SDL2 and textures instead of
bitmaps. It loses some of its beauty, but makes it a lot faster and
easier to bring up on modern systems.

As part of the refactor the old 'libbitblit' (which allowed one to
target a bunch of different outputs) has been replaced by SDL2 (in
some sense a modern equivalent of libbitblit?). That is, this is _not_
the repository you want if you want to build mgr for a pre-2000
system.

It should build and run, and can render terminals (err, without
cursors), but it's a bit of a mess in many ways and most client
applications won't actually work.

PLAN has some indication of the many things I'm currently thinking of
doing.

If you're crazy enough to try it now, with every somewhere between
completely broken and mostly broken:

- make sure you have libpam0g-dev and libsdl2-dev or similar
- set ROOTDIR in Configfile to the location you cloned the repo

    cd src/mgr
    make
    ./mgr

Your system probably knows about mgr's terminal, but not about
colours, so you may want to update terminfo/termcap using the files in
the misc directory (but colours are also a bit broken). If you want to
set the resolution, modify DEFAULT_WIDTH and DEFAULT_HEIGHT in
Configfile.
