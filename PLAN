Currently:
- fixing the bits that I turned off to get things working
  (e.g. all the #ifdefs and similar) and TODOs and //
- horrifying amount of completely untested code... when it actually compiles,
  a lot to check.

- OTHER IN PROGRESS
    - W(style) usage -> needs to be replaced with color, use bit_blit_color etc.
        -> some of this has just been hacked out incorrectly - should have
           fg/bg colours in window rather than style (?)
    - mouse appearing now when it shouldn't (or originally didn't) with move to sdl cursor
      (box drawing? Can't remember what else)
    - colour support... (vile badly broken now, working before colours, need
      to add to termcap + make sure mgr codes are still working)
    - finish support of VT100 style [ colours (this should actually be pretty easy)
- get rid of all the pre-compiled icon/font stuff
  (unnecessary complexity) - or at least use xxd...
- SIGWINCH sent in mgr?
- SIGWINCH received from SDL?
- dropped erase_win from suspend/lock; should check behaviour

Fix the threading stuff:

- this is _mostly_ done
- need to fix signal handling
- why weird -1 buffer overflow hack for shell read?
- remove the random 'mouse_get_waits' and improve state machine on main loop
     - menus with callbacks (i.e. do_button can return a 'menu'
       rather than performing an immediate action)
     - move/resize operations (get_rect)
     - copy (get_text)
     - after this, can drop 'screen' texture.

Figure out how to fix enhance_font.

Fix buckey_key things.
- did something - need to check if working. Segfaults?

Get cut/paste working. Will need to have main buffer. This will also fix block cursor

Left/Right mouse button confusion? (HOWTO says left for main menu)

Trackpad support/2 button support (keyboard modifier?)
  - I ripped out the 3rd mouse button emu

Support resolution things on startup; attempt to simplify Configfile
as much as possible (just start killing all the options and remove the script).
Drop m4 (?)
   - also, .mgrrc at the same time...

Separate out clients into those that build and those that don't.

Fix raster op situation (i.e. change API, and convert things using
B_SET/B_CLEAR to use fill_rect, and B_COPY to use copy, and...)

Pull the usr folders into the main repo so it's trivial to build.
 -> make sure I include the updated terminfo with home so top/nvi work

Force LANG=C to avoid unicode issues? (how?)

Reconstruct history - use modern uncrustify on both sides.

RELEASE.

Future stuff (?) <- STOP THINKING ABOUT THIS STUFF FOR NOW

- handle texture reset? (or force SDL to OpenGL mode,
  since I think then texture resets won't happen)
- tile bg_pattern (? - PR open against SDL2 to support)
- use fancy 'modern' tilemap gpu stuff
  (i.e. effectively emulating an old style terminal, where
  we just write a texture which has lookups into the 
  font bitmap... though then we're tied to OpenGL; may
  as well just use glfw... but this makes it hard to do the graphics modes)
- profile to see where slow-downs actually are
- add wayland and kmsdrm SDLWaitEvent to sdl2
- add something to SDLWaitEvent so we can wait on fds as well (?)
  - unclear how we can do this sanely in a cross-platformish way
- make sure w3m works including image support
  (i.e. add program for mgr style images? or sixel?)
- Similarly, browsh (text firefox)
- generalised better terminal support
- consider having terminal windows support an HTML mode
  (i.e. special escape sequence switches to HTML mode, and use
  something like litehtml - or something fancier - to render...
  + then send form subs etc. to stdout)
- consider making some kind of protocol so we can do SDL in SDL and
  support Netsurf (currently 1.2) and lite-xl
  - am I reinventing Wayland? Support a Wayland subset sufficient for SDL?
  - any socket? thrift sdl wrapper?
  - unix domain socket with shm SDLSurfaces?
  - ...
